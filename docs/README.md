```

Use `gem` to install `bundler`:

```

To build and run using the [Gemfile](Gemfile) environment:

* [_data](_data)
* [_includes](_includes) - reusable page snippets
* [_includes/src](_includes/src) - source code examples 
* [_layouts](_layouts) - maps page variables and content to html output
* [_sass](_sass) - reusable css snippets
* [assets/css](assets/css)
* [assets/images](assets/images)
* [assets/js](assets/js)
* [_config.yaml](_config.yaml) Jekyell configuration including global variables

* [guide](guide) - Programming Guide

## Pages

Each page of content starts with a YAML front matter snippet located between two ``---`` lines.

```Markdown
---
layout: default
title: Welcome
nav_order: 5
---

# {{ page.title }}

Visit [Eclipse ImageN](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.imagen) project
page for more information.
```

The front matter snippet defines variables used for our page layout, and is followed by Markdown used to define page `{{ content }}`.

The `nav_order` is used by the site theme, for details see [navigation structure](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/).

## Code Examples

Markdown highlighting is used for code snippets:

````
```java
   // Retrieve and report the mean pixel value.
   double[] mean = (double[])meanImage.getProperty("mean");
   System.out.println("Band 0 mean = " + mean[0]);
```
````

Complete code examples are placed in [_includes/src](_includes/src) folder:

````
```java
{% include src/ImageNSampleProgram.java %}
```
